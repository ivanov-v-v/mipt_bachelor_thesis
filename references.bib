However, there have been few systematic studies to understand the mechanism(s) responsible for losses of heterozygosity in such tumors. Here we report a detailed investigation of the five chromosomes lost most frequently in human colorectal cancers. A total of 10,216 determinations were made with 88 microsatellite markers, revealing 245 chromosomal loss events. The mechanisms of loss were remarkably chromosome-specific. Some chromosomes displayed complete loss such as that predicted to result from mitotic nondisjunction. However, more than half of the losses were associated with losses of only part of a chromosome rather than a whole chromosome. Surprisingly, these losses were due largely to structural alterations rather than to mitotic recombination, break-induced replication, or gene conversion, suggesting novel mechanisms for the generation of much of the aneuploidy in this common tumor type.

	abstract = {Abstract Detailed analysis of mechanisms of genetic loss for specific tumor suppressor genes (TSGs; e.g., RB1, APC and NF1) indicates that TSG inactivation can occur by allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH), without any alteration in DNA copy number. However, the role and prevalence of such events in the pathogenesis of specific malignancies remains to be established on a genome-wide basis. We undertook a detailed molecular assessment of chromosomal defects in a panel of nine cell lines derived from primary medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood, by parallel genome-wide assessment of LOH (allelotyping) and copy number aberrations (comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization). The majority of genetic losses observed were detected by both copy number and LOH methods, indicating they arise through the physical deletion of chromosomal material. However, a significant proportion of losses (17/42, 40\%) represented regions of allelic LOH without any associated copy number reduction; these events involved both whole chromosomes (10/17) and sub-chromosomal regions (7/17). Using this approach, we identified medulloblastoma-characteristic alterations, e.g., isochromosome for 17q, MYC amplification and losses on chromosomes 10, 11, and 16, alongside novel regions of genetic loss (e.g., 10q21.1-26.3, 11q24.1-qter). This detailed genetic characterization of the majority of medulloblastoma cell lines provides important precedent for the widespread involvement of copy number-neutral genetic losses in medulloblastoma and demonstrates that combined assessment of copy number aberrations and LOH will be necessary to accurately determine the contribution of chromosomal defects to tumor development.

	abstract = {UPD (uniparental disomy) describes the inheritance of a pair of chromosomes from only one parent. Mechanisms that lead to UPD include trisomy rescue, gamete complementation, monosomy rescue and somatic recombination. Most of these mechanisms can involve aberrant chromosomes, particularly isochromosomes and Robertsonian translocations. In the last decade, the number of UPD cases reported in the literature has increased exponentially. This is partly due to the advances in genomic technologies that have allowed for high-resolution SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) studies, which have complemented traditional methods relying on polymorphic microsatellite markers. In this review, we discuss aberrant cellular mechanisms leading to UPD and their impact on gene expression. Special emphasis is placed on the unmasking of mutant recessive alleles and the disruption of imprinted gene dosage, which give rise to specific and recurrent imprinting phenotypes. Finally, we discuss how copy number maps determined from SNP array datasets have helped identify not only deletions and duplications but also recurrent copy number neutral regions of loss-of-heterozygosity, which have been reported in many cancer types and that may constitute an important driving force in cancer. These tiny regions of UPD also alter imprinted gene dosage, which may have cumulative tumourgenic effects in addition to that of unmasking homozygous cancer-associated mutations.},

Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40{\%} of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection.},

Using an amplification-free single-cell genome sequencing approach implemented on commodity hardware (DLP+) coupled with a cloud-based computational platform, we define a resource of 40,000 single-cell genomes characterized by their genome states, across a wide range of tissue types and conditions. We show that shallow sequencing across thousands of genomes permits reconstruction of clonal genomes to single nucleotide resolution through aggregation analysis of cells sharing higher order genome structure. From large-scale population analysis over thousands of cells, we identify rare cells exhibiting mitotic mis-segregation of whole chromosomes. We observe that tissue derived scWGS libraries exhibit lower rates of whole chromosome anueploidy than cell lines, and loss of p53 results in a shift in event type, but not overall prevalence in breast epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that the replication states of genomes can be identified, allowing the number and proportion of replicating cells, as well as the chromosomal pattern of replication to be unambiguously identified in single-cell genome sequencing experiments. The combined annotated resource and approach provide a re-implementable large scale platform for studying lineages and tissue heterogeneity.},

	of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
	moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
	efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
	of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
	data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
	objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
	hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
	tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
	discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
	algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
	to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.

	abstract={Single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal unexplored biological diversity, but they suffer from technical noise and bias that must be modeled to account for the resulting uncertainty in downstream analyses. Here we introduce single-cell variational inference (scVI), a ready-to-use scalable framework for the probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells (https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI). scVI uses stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to aggregate information across similar cells and genes and to approximate the distributions that underlie observed expression values, while accounting for batch effects and limited sensitivity. We used scVI for a range of fundamental analysis tasks including batch correction, visualization, clustering, and differential expression, and achieved high accuracy for each task.},

	abstract = {Multi-trait mixed models have emerged as a promising approach for joint analyses of multiple traits. In principle, the mixed model framework is remarkably general. However, current methods implement only a very specific range of tasks to optimize the necessary computations. Here, we present a multi-trait modeling framework that is versatile and fast: LIMIX enables to flexibly adapt mixed models for a broad range of applications with different observed and hidden covariates, and variable study designs. To highlight the novel modeling aspects of LIMIX we performed three vastly different genetic studies: joint GWAS of correlated blood lipid phenotypes, joint analysis of the expression levels of the multiple transcript-isoforms of a gene, and pathway-based modeling of molecular traits across environments. In these applications we show that LIMIX increases GWAS power and phenotype prediction accuracy, in particular when integrating stepwise multi-locus regression into multi-trait models, and when analyzing large numbers of traits. An open source implementation of LIMIX is freely available at: https://github.com/PMBio/limix.},

Here, we outline eleven challenges that will be central to bringing this emerging field of single-cell data science forward. For each challenge, we highlight motivating research questions, review prior work, and formulate open problems. This compendium is for established researchers, newcomers, and students alike, highlighting interesting and rewarding problems for the coming years.},

	abstract={The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body. The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.},
