However, there have been few systematic studies to understand the mechanism(s) responsible for losses of heterozygosity in such tumors. Here we report a detailed investigation of the five chromosomes lost most frequently in human colorectal cancers. A total of 10,216 determinations were made with 88 microsatellite markers, revealing 245 chromosomal loss events. The mechanisms of loss were remarkably chromosome-specific. Some chromosomes displayed complete loss such as that predicted to result from mitotic nondisjunction. However, more than half of the losses were associated with losses of only part of a chromosome rather than a whole chromosome. Surprisingly, these losses were due largely to structural alterations rather than to mitotic recombination, break-induced replication, or gene conversion, suggesting novel mechanisms for the generation of much of the aneuploidy in this common tumor type.

	abstract = {Abstract Detailed analysis of mechanisms of genetic loss for specific tumor suppressor genes (TSGs; e.g., RB1, APC and NF1) indicates that TSG inactivation can occur by allelic loss of heterozygosity (LOH), without any alteration in DNA copy number. However, the role and prevalence of such events in the pathogenesis of specific malignancies remains to be established on a genome-wide basis. We undertook a detailed molecular assessment of chromosomal defects in a panel of nine cell lines derived from primary medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood, by parallel genome-wide assessment of LOH (allelotyping) and copy number aberrations (comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization). The majority of genetic losses observed were detected by both copy number and LOH methods, indicating they arise through the physical deletion of chromosomal material. However, a significant proportion of losses (17/42, 40\%) represented regions of allelic LOH without any associated copy number reduction; these events involved both whole chromosomes (10/17) and sub-chromosomal regions (7/17). Using this approach, we identified medulloblastoma-characteristic alterations, e.g., isochromosome for 17q, MYC amplification and losses on chromosomes 10, 11, and 16, alongside novel regions of genetic loss (e.g., 10q21.1-26.3, 11q24.1-qter). This detailed genetic characterization of the majority of medulloblastoma cell lines provides important precedent for the widespread involvement of copy number-neutral genetic losses in medulloblastoma and demonstrates that combined assessment of copy number aberrations and LOH will be necessary to accurately determine the contribution of chromosomal defects to tumor development.

	abstract = {UPD (uniparental disomy) describes the inheritance of a pair of chromosomes from only one parent. Mechanisms that lead to UPD include trisomy rescue, gamete complementation, monosomy rescue and somatic recombination. Most of these mechanisms can involve aberrant chromosomes, particularly isochromosomes and Robertsonian translocations. In the last decade, the number of UPD cases reported in the literature has increased exponentially. This is partly due to the advances in genomic technologies that have allowed for high-resolution SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) studies, which have complemented traditional methods relying on polymorphic microsatellite markers. In this review, we discuss aberrant cellular mechanisms leading to UPD and their impact on gene expression. Special emphasis is placed on the unmasking of mutant recessive alleles and the disruption of imprinted gene dosage, which give rise to specific and recurrent imprinting phenotypes. Finally, we discuss how copy number maps determined from SNP array datasets have helped identify not only deletions and duplications but also recurrent copy number neutral regions of loss-of-heterozygosity, which have been reported in many cancer types and that may constitute an important driving force in cancer. These tiny regions of UPD also alter imprinted gene dosage, which may have cumulative tumourgenic effects in addition to that of unmasking homozygous cancer-associated mutations.},

Here, by whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,658 cancers as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)4, we reconstruct the life history and evolution of mutational processes and driver mutation sequences of 38 types of cancer. Early oncogenesis is characterized by mutations in a constrained set of driver genes, and specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma and isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. The mutational spectrum changes significantly throughout tumour evolution in 40{\%} of samples. A nearly fourfold diversification of driver genes and increased genomic instability are features of later stages. Copy number alterations often occur in mitotic crises, and lead to simultaneous gains of chromosomal segments. Timing analyses suggest that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, if not decades. Together, these results determine the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, and highlight opportunities for early cancer detection.},

Using an amplification-free single-cell genome sequencing approach implemented on commodity hardware (DLP+) coupled with a cloud-based computational platform, we define a resource of 40,000 single-cell genomes characterized by their genome states, across a wide range of tissue types and conditions. We show that shallow sequencing across thousands of genomes permits reconstruction of clonal genomes to single nucleotide resolution through aggregation analysis of cells sharing higher order genome structure. From large-scale population analysis over thousands of cells, we identify rare cells exhibiting mitotic mis-segregation of whole chromosomes. We observe that tissue derived scWGS libraries exhibit lower rates of whole chromosome anueploidy than cell lines, and loss of p53 results in a shift in event type, but not overall prevalence in breast epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that the replication states of genomes can be identified, allowing the number and proportion of replicating cells, as well as the chromosomal pattern of replication to be unambiguously identified in single-cell genome sequencing experiments. The combined annotated resource and approach provide a re-implementable large scale platform for studying lineages and tissue heterogeneity.},
